Working with BASIC was really fun! It was full of surprises and I forgot how much
I enjoy assembly language. Kinda. But learning how all of these parts fit together
was a lot of fun! I enjoyed learning about the different aspects, how simple it was
how much it took just to run a single command. It really gave me an appreciation
for how coding today works. Running these commands, making variable, and storing
values were all really interesting for seeing step by step how a machine works.
I had a lot of fun writing and making these practicals and projects. I might
continue working in this for fun.
